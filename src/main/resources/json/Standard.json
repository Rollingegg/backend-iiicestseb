{"title": "Keynotes", "authors": [], "abstract": "With the development of big data, machine learning, and AI, existing software engineering techniques must be reimagined to provide the productivity gains that developers desire. This talk will review emerging roles of data scientists and the tools they need to build scalable, correct, and efficient software for a data centric world. Kim will present a large-scale study of about 800 data scientists in collaboration with Microsoft Research, which looked at data scientists' educational background, problem topics that they work on, tools they use, and activities. From the gathered data, she has identified nine distinct clusters of data scientists and best practices and challenges faced by each cluster. In the second half of this talk, she will discuss the needs of retargeting SE research community's directions to address new challenges in the era of data-centric software development. In particular, she will detail some examples of her group's work that re-invents debugging and testing for big data distributed systems such as Apache Spark. She will conclude with open SE problems in ML and heterogeneous computing that support data-centric software development.", "keywords": [{"type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing", "kwd": ["Big Data", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "software engineering"]}, {"type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing", "kwd": ["big data", "software engineering", "data-centric software development", "machine learning", "AI", "Microsoft Research", "productivity gains"]}], "publication": "2019 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)", "doi": "10.1109/ASE.2019.00010", "ref": [], "pdfLink": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8952191", "articleId": "8952191", "startPage": "36", "endPage": "38", "pubLink": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8949433/proceeding", "issueLink": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952167", "publisher": "IEEE", "confLoc": "San Diego, CA, USA, USA", "chronDate": "11-15 Nov. 2019", "metrics": {"citationCountPaper": 0, "citationCountPatent": 0, "totalDownloads": 9}}

Surprisingly, there are very few works that study statistical problems in software engineering (SE). Aim: Assess the existence of statistical errors in SE experiments. Method: Compile the most common statistical errors in experimental disciplines. Survey experiments published in ICSE to assess whether errors occur in high quality SE publications. Results: The same errors as identified in others disciplines were found in ICSE experiments, where 30 of the reviewed papers included several error types such as: a) missing statistical hypotheses, b) missing sample size calculation, c) failure to assess statistical test assumptions, and d) uncorrected multiple testing. This rather large error rate is greater for research papers where experiments are confined to the validation section. The origin of the errors can be traced back to: a) researchers not having sufficient statistical training, and b) a profusion of exploratory research. Conclusions: This paper provides preliminary evidence that SE research suffers from the same statistical problems as other experimental disciplines. However, the SE community appears to be unaware of any shortcomings in its experiments, whereas other disciplines work hard to avoid these threats. Further research is necessary to find the underlying causes and set up corrective measures, but there are some potentially effective actions and are a priori easy to implement: a) improve the statistical training of SE researchers, and b) enforce quality assessment and reporting guidelines in SE publications.", "keywords": [{"type": "IEEE Keywords", "kwd": ["Software engineering", "Bibliographies", "Training", "Guidelines", "Error analysis", "Back"]}, {"type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing", "kwd": ["psychology", "research and development", "software engineering", "statistical testing"]}, {"type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing", "kwd": ["software engineering experiments", "SE experiments", "high quality SE publications", "ICSE experiments", "statistical hypotheses", "statistical test assumptions", "SE community", "SE researchers", "quality assessment", "statistical errors", "statistical training", "SE research"]}, {"type": "Author Keywords ", "kwd": ["Literature review", "Survey", "Prevalence", "Statistical errors"]}], "publication": "2018 IEEE/ACM 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "doi": "10.1145/3180155.3180161", "ref": [], "pdfLink": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453201", "articleId": "8453201", "startPage": "1195", "endPage": "1206", "pubLink": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8452039/proceeding", "issueLink": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8453044", "publisher": "IEEE", "confLoc": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "chronDate": "May 27 2018-June 3 2018", "metrics": {"citationCountPaper": 0, "citationCountPatent": 0, "totalDownloads": 84}}
